# 📘 ML Fundamentals – Math to Code
This repository documents my journey of turning Stanford CS229 math notes into working machine learning projects using Python (Google Colab).

Instead of stopping at equations, each notebook:
- Starts with the math derivation
- Translates it into step-by-step code
- Builds visualizations to connect theory with practice

The goal: strengthen ML foundations by seeing how math directly powers real models.

## 🚀 Completed Projects
### **Linear Regression with Gradient Descent (Housing Prices)**

1. Derived the Mean Squared Error (MSE) cost function
2. Implemented the gradient descent update rule from scratch
3. Plotted Cost vs Iterations to show convergence
4. Built a simple predictor for housing prices

## 🧠 Learning Method
Each project follows the same structure:

1. Start with Math – review CS229 derivation
2. Code Implementation – translate step by step
3. Visualization – graphs/plots to show error minimization
4. ML Intuition – how this improves predictions

## 📖 Upcoming Topics

- Logistic Regression + Gradient Descent
- Regularization (L1 / L2)
- Softmax Regression
- Neural Networks (Backprop basics)
- Support Vector Machines
- PCA & Dimensionality Reduction
